# Home Assistant Mealie Integration

Early dev, nothing to see here


## Calendar meal times
If you want to modify the default meal times displayed in the calendar you can add the following to your `configuration.yaml`

```
mealie:
  breakfast_start: "07:00"
  breakfast_end: "11:00"
  lunch_start: "11:30"
  lunch_end: "14:00"
  dinner_start: "16:00"
  dinner_end: "21:00"
```
